**Voice-Controlled Coding Assistant**

This is my take on reimagining how we write code — ditching the keyboard (mostly) and letting your voice do the heavy lifting. Think VS Code meets GitHub Codespaces meets AI that actually listens to you. The goal here is a clean, dark, developer-friendly space with some bright electric blue/purple highlights so you know when the AI is paying attention.

For this first version, I kept it to the essentials:

A landing page that explains what’s going on

A main coding interface with an editor that feels familiar if you’ve ever touched VS Code

Voice recording controls so you can talk to your code

Real-time transcription so you can see exactly what you just said (and catch when it misunderstood you)

Mock AI code generation to make the whole thing feel alive

A file navigation sidebar so you can jump between files without touching a mouse

A command history panel so you can look back and see how you got here

The idea is to get the vibe right first — smooth animations, pulsing indicators when it’s listening, a layout that feels like an actual dev tool and not a clunky prototype. From here, it’s not a huge leap to plug in real AI models, adaptive syntax learning, and proper debugging commands.

If you want to run it:

Clone this repo

Open index.html in your browser

Start talking to your editor

This is just the start — the plan is to turn this into a full AI-powered development environment that can understand your coding style, explain your bugs, and maybe even argue with you about why your variable names are terrible.
